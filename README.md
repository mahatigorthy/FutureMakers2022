# FutureMakers2022

The MIT FutureMakers Create-a-thon is a virtual, part-time 6-week AI learning program, developed through a collaboration between SureStart (https://mysurestart.com/) and the MIT RAISE (Responsible AI for Social Empowerment and Education) Initiative (https://raise.mit.edu/)

The FutureMakers program, which started on July 6th, 2021 includes:

- Learning AI, machine learning and emotion AI concepts
- Turning skills into confidence through building AI solutions hands-on
- Consistent support and encouragement from a mentor 1-1
- Regular tech talks and career readiness seminars.
- Entrepreneurship and leadership skills development

This 6-week virtual program provided me with a unique opportunity to build AI solutions that tackle some of todayâ€™s most pressing challenges.
