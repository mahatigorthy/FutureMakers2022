# FutureMakers2022

The MIT FutureMakers Create-a-thon is a virtual, part-time 6-week AI learning program, developed through a collaboration between [SureStart](https://mysurestart.com/) and the [MIT RAISE](https://raise.mit.edu/) (Responsible AI for Social Empowerment and Education) Initiative 

The FutureMakers program, which started on July 6th, 2021 includes:

- Learning AI, machine learning and emotion AI concepts
- Turning skills into confidence through building AI solutions hands-on
- Consistent support and encouragement from a mentor 1-1
- Regular tech talks and career readiness seminars.
- Entrepreneurship and leadership skills development

This 6-week virtual program provided me with a unique opportunity to build AI solutions that tackle some of todayâ€™s most pressing challenges.

The last two weeks were a create-a-thon for which my team developed a program to detect media bias in news articles to help alleviate political polarization and provide a more hollistic view of current events.
